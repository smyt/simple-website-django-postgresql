We are proud that our team has a healthy atmosphere. We are sorry to waste time on
intrigue and gossip, because there are many other interesting topics: the Bitcoin course,
Pelevin's books, a new series of Games of Thrones or Mr. Robot, new events in
favorite universes from Fallout to Call of Duty. We do not have a rank hierarchy, you can
freely apply to each of the employees, whatever position he occupied.
Any manager will be happy to hear and discuss your ideas and suggestions.
